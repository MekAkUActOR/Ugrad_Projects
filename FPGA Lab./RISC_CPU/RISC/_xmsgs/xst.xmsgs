<msg type="warning" file="Xst" num="647" delta="new" >Input &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">clk_fetch</arg>&gt; is never used. This port will be preserved and left unconnected if it belongs to a top-level block or it belongs to a sub-block and the hierarchy of this sub-block is preserved.

<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="2117" delta="new" >HDL ADVISOR - Mux Selector &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">state</arg>&gt; of Case statement line <arg fmt="%s" index="2">51</arg> was re-encoded using one-hot encoding. The case statement will be optimized (default statement optimization), but this optimization may lead to design initialization problems. To ensure the design works safely, you can:
	- add an &apos;<arg fmt="%s" index="3">INIT</arg>&apos; attribute on signal &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="4">state</arg>&gt; (optimization is then done without any risk)
	- use the attribute &apos;<arg fmt="%s" index="5">signal_encoding</arg> <arg fmt="%s" index="6">user</arg>&apos; to avoid onehot optimization
	- use the attribute &apos;<arg fmt="%s" index="7">safe_implementation</arg> <arg fmt="%s" index="8">yes</arg>&apos; to force XST to perform a safe (but less efficient) optimization

<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="2169" delta="new" >HDL ADVISOR - Some clock signals were not automatically buffered by XST with BUFG/BUFR resources. Please use the buffer_type constraint in order to insert these buffers to the clock signals to help prevent skew problems.
